DESCRIPTION

This is a *very, very* simple back propagating neural network, inspired 
almost entirely by the widely used bpnn.py library by Neil Schemenauer
(found here: http://arctrix.com/nas/). His Python library is remarkably simple, 
combining real, valuable utility with readability and accessibility. I got
great enjoyment out of tinkering with it so I essentially decided to write a
slightly modified port in C. This can be used to perform some elementary 
supervised learning tasks on its own but its value probably lays in being the
foundation for a larger library or piece of work.

The activation and derivative calculations use the same formulas as bpnn.py 
(with hyperbolic tangent as the choice for the sigmoid and (1 - y^2) for the 
output derivative). The back propagation is done by first propagating the error
terms for the output and hidden layers and then updating the weight matrices for
each output node and each input node.

INSTRUCTIONS

For use as a library:

Call init_rand to seed the pseudorandom generator.

Then create a neural_network structure to work with and initialize it with the
correct amount of nodes per layer (with the input and output layers having node
counts which equal the training set) and a pointer to the struct. The pointer
will be passed into all functions which deal directly with the network. 

Then provide the training set, such as the globally defined "patterns" (see the
BUGS section), and call train_network. Parameters include the amount of sets in 
the training data (ie. 4 in the sample set "patterns"), the learing and momentum
rates, the previously mentioned net pointers and the amount of iterations to 
perform. Here is where the benefit of C shines through as initial testing shows
that the network can perform 1,000,000+ iterations quickly (with a significant
portion of the runtime devoted to superfluously printing every 100th error 
term). After training to your heart's content, either provide a new data set for
testing (or use the same data set if you are so inclined for some reason) and
call test_network.

Compilation:

Snatch up the source and the header (and the test file if you want to play 
around with it) and run:

$ gcc -Wall test.c backprop.c -o [executable name]
$ ./[executable name]

If one is experimenting with the network, you can find the sample training set
declared in backprop.h and defined in backprop.c: just change the data set as
desired and change the dimensions of the set accordingly. You will also need
to change the amount of sets in your data in the calls to train_network and 
test_network in test.c. You can also find the training parameters in test.c, 
currently set to 10,000 iterations, a learning rate of 0.5 and a momentum factor
of 0.1.

EXAMPLE

As was shown in the demo of bpnn.py, the network can be trained to perform XOR 
logic. With a training set of:

double patterns[4][2][2] = { {{0,0},{0}} , {{0,1},{1}} , {{1,0},{1}} , {{1,1},{0}} };

and learing and momentum rates of 0.5 and 0.1, respectively, 1,000 iterations of
training will yield this upon testing the same set:

error 0.68834
error 0.00435
error 0.00146
error 0.00083
error 0.00057
error 0.00043
error 0.00034
error 0.00028
error 0.00024
error 0.00021
0 0 -> 0.00000000 
0 1 -> 0.99133570 
1 0 -> 0.99093383 
1 1 -> 0.00953049 

More iterations will provide more accurate data, while increasing the learning  
and momentum rates will tend to amplify gradients in the weight matrices from 
iteration to iteration.

BUGS

Currently, one has to utilize the globally declared and defined "patterns" 
variable to manipulate and maintain the data sets to be fed to the network. This
is entirely because I have not yet found a clean, efficient way to handle the
passing of what are essentially three dimensional arrays into the train_network
and test_network functions, nor have I found a similarly effective way to
create the pointer to pointers to pointers which would be ideal.

Of course this is not a good way to do this.
